# signposter

**Status (BOOTSTRAP-002):** Structural skeleton complete.  
**Orchestration logic:** Not implemented.  
**Implementation phase:** Not started.

Signposter is a local GitHub / OpenClaw workflow dispatcher designed to stay completely separate from the Neutral Agent Pack.

## Current State

Only the following exists:

- Package directory structure under `src/signposter/`
- Configuration contracts and example files
- High-level architecture documentation
- Basic test skeleton

No actual dispatch, scheduling, GitHub integration, or state machine logic has been written.

## Available Commands (Bootstrap Phase)

### `signposter doctor`

Run a read-only preflight check of the local environment:

```bash
signposter doctor
```

The doctor command verifies:
- Python version compatibility
- Git repository and working tree status
- Presence of `gh` (GitHub CLI) and authentication state
- Presence of `openclaw`
- Availability of `pytest` and `ruff`
- Existence of example configuration files
- Existence of core documentation

It is safe to run at any time and makes no changes.

### `signposter scan`

Read-only scanner for GitHub repositories (bootstrap phase):

```bash
signposter scan --repo ExatronOmega/signposter
```

The scanner reports:
- Count of open issues and pull requests
- Recent workflow runs
- Items matching neutral workflow labels (`state:ready`, `phase:*`, `gate:*`, etc.)

It uses the GitHub CLI in read-only mode and performs **no** mutations.

## Configuration Contracts

Example configuration files in `configs/` define the structural contracts for:
- Repositories under management
- Routing rules
- Label semantics
- Worker roles (planner, reviewer, executor, gatekeeper, ...)
- Scheduler behavior

These files use only comments and safe dummy values.

## Documentation

See `docs/` for current structural thinking:
- `architecture.md`
- `workflow.md`
- `labels.md`
- `state-machine.md`

## Development Setup

```bash
cd ~/projects/signposter

# Activate venv (created during skeleton setup)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Re-install in editable mode after changes
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Validation

```bash
ruff check .
pytest -v
```

**Important:** This project must remain clearly separated from the Neutral Agent Pack at all times.
